### **NOTE: iOS AC is disabled, and only luau and other detections that no one knows of are enabled, and there's no such detectiions that will crash you**

## How This Was Done

**1. String cross-references**
Ghidra lets you find every piece of code that touches a string literal. Strings like `"attempt to call"`, `"__index"`, `"not enough memory"`, and `"13lua_exception"` are anchor points. Find the string, find the function that uses it, read what it does to nearby memory, and you've got struct offsets basically for free.

**2. Known-value anchors in global_State**
The `tmname[]` and `ttname[]` arrays are a gift. They hold interned strings for every metamethod (`"__index"`, `"__call"`, etc.) and type name (`"nil"`, `"string"`, etc.) in a fixed order defined by the Luau source. Find any one entry and you've pinned the entire array - and by extension, the base address of `global_State`.

**3. lua_newstate / luaE_newstate as free layout maps**
The state initializers write to basically every important field at startup. `lua_newstate` gives you the allocator, userdata, panic handler, mainthread pointer, GC parameters, and the combined allocation size. `luaE_newstate` fills in `_G`, the registry, metamethod strings, and the pinned error strings. Just read the store sequences.

**4. Store-sequence analysis**
When a known function allocates a struct and immediately fills it in (like `luaD_precall` pushing a new `CallInfo`), the stores happen in field order. Reading them gives you the layout directly. This is also how we caught that a lot of public references have `CallInfo` wrong - `func` is not at `ci+0x00` in this binary.

**5. Bytecode loader as a layout oracle**
`luaU_undump` (`FUN_03f7ef1c`) writes to every single Proto field during deserialization. Decompiling it gives you the complete Proto layout in one shot - no scanning required.

**6. Jython scripting for bulk extraction**
For things like the opcode dispatch table (256 entries) or scanning all interpreter instructions for a specific access pattern, Ghidra's Jython console is faster than clicking. Scripts in this doc can be re-run against updated binaries to spot changes quickly.

**7. C++ exception type_info**
Roblox's iOS build throws C++ exceptions for Lua errors instead of using `longjmp`. The `__cxa_throw` call passes a `std::type_info*`, which contains an Itanium-mangled class name string. Follow the pointer, read the string, and you get the class name and layout handed to you.

**Confidence levels:**
- `[HIGH]` - seen directly in the decompiler or disassembly, no guessing involved
- `[MED]` - inferred from context, consistent with Luau source patterns
- `[LOW]` - the field exists, but what it actually means is a best guess

---

## Combined Allocation Layout

`lua_newstate` allocates **one contiguous block of 0x4710 bytes** for both the main thread state and the global state. They are not separate heap allocations.

```
[base + 0x0000] = lua_State    (main thread)
[base + 0x0080] = global_State
[base + 0x4710] = end of allocation
```

`L->l_G` (at L+0x18) is set to `base + 0x80`, confirming the split. Coroutines have their own separately allocated `lua_State` but share the same `global_State` via their own `l_G` pointer.

## TValue (0x10 bytes)

## TString

sizeof(TString) = 0x18 + len + 1
```

> **TString+0x04 / +0x06:** `luaS_newlstr` writes both fields in a single 4-byte store:
> `*(uint32*)(s + 4) = 0x8000FFFF` (little-endian: `0xFFFF` at +0x04, `0x8000` at +0x06).
> `atom = -1` (0xFFFF as int16) is the standard "not yet assigned" sentinel. `atom2 = 0x8000`
> (INT16_MIN) mirrors the same pattern - almost certainly a second intern index, possibly for
> `__namecall` or another Roblox-specific string table.

Permanently pinned strings (marked |= 8 in `luaE_newstate`):
- `"not enough memory"`
- `"error in error handling"`

## CallInfo (0x28 bytes)

              bit 1 = LUA_CALLINFO_HANDLE  (checked by lua_resumeerror when
                       walking the CI chain looking for an error handler)
              bit 2 = LUA_CALLINFO_NATIVE  (set by luaD_precall when
                       proto->execdata or proto->code is non-null; signals
                       that this frame should execute via native code)
```

> Roblox shifted the layout; +0x08 is likely padding or a moved field.

> binary. The write `*(param_2+0x10) = *(g+0x28)` followed by `*(g+0x28) = param_2` is
> the standard gray list prepend pattern, placing `gclist` at +0x10 for all GC objects.

## LuaNode (0x20 bytes)

Each slot in the Table hash part. Key type tag and next-chain offset are packed into a single `uint32` to save space.

```cpp
node + 0x00 = val.value  (8 bytes - value union)              [HIGH]
node + 0x08 = val.vec_z  (float - vector Z if val is LUA_TVECTOR, else 0) [HIGH]
node + 0x0c = val.tt     (int - value type tag)               [HIGH]
node + 0x10 = key.value  (8 bytes - key union; TString* for string keys) [HIGH]
node + 0x18 = key.vec_z  (float - vector Z if key is LUA_TVECTOR, else 0) [HIGH]
node + 0x1c = packed uint32:                                   [HIGH]
                bits  [3:0]  = key.tt  (type tag)
                bits [31:4]  = next offset (signed, in LuaNode units of 0x20 bytes)
```

Hash lookup: `bucket = TString->hash & nodemask` (Table+0x03).
Chain end: `node+0x1c < 0x10` - means next==0 and key==nil (empty or end of chain).

## Error / Exception Mechanism

Roblox's iOS build uses **C++ exceptions**, not `setjmp`/`longjmp`. There are no `setjmp`
buffers anywhere in `lua_State`. Stop looking.

```cpp
// class lua_exception : public std::exception  (single inheritance, global namespace)
// ABI: __cxxabiv1::__si_class_type_info

exception_object + 0x00 = vtable*     → DAT_05dadd88
exception_object + 0x08 = lua_State*  (the throwing thread)
exception_object + 0x10 = int         (LUA_ERR* error code)

05dadd60     = lua_exception typeinfo object
04ebd59c     = "13lua_exception"  (Itanium mangled; demangles to: lua_exception)
DAT_05dadd88 = lua_exception vtable
```

`luaD_throw` allocates via `__cxa_allocate_exception(0x18)` and calls `__cxa_throw`.
Catch sites in `lua_resume` / `luaD_pcall` use `try/catch` blocks - not `setjmp`.

## Opcode Dispatch

> ⚠️ **Roblox uses a three-layer opcode shuffle per build.** No value in this section
> directly corresponds to the open-source Luau opcode enum. Do not cross-reference these
> numbers with Luau source.

### Three-layer shuffle pipeline

```
Standard Luau enum  (0, 1, 2 ... LOP_NOP, LOP_BREAK, LOP_LOADNIL ...)
        ↓  per-build file-format shuffle (unknown table, applied at compile time)
File opcode byte    (stored in .luac bytecode on disk)
        ↓  DAT_04ebdd10[file_byte]  applied by luaU_undump at load time
Runtime opcode byte (stored in Proto->code[] in memory)
        ↓  DAT_05daf138[runtime_byte * 8]  dereferenced at execute time
Handler address     (the actual function or inline dispatch branch)
```

- **`DAT_04ebdd10`** (`0x04ebdd10`) - 256-byte unshuffle table. Indexed by file opcode byte, produces the runtime opcode byte. Applied in-place by `luaU_undump` during deserialization: `*pbVar32 = DAT_04ebdd10[*pbVar32]`.
- **`DAT_04ebde10`** (`0x04ebde10`) - 256-byte instruction size table. Indexed by the value produced by `DAT_04ebdd10`. The raw bytes are **encoded** - `FUN_03035e5c` (`luaO_instcount`) applies a transformation before the result is used as the instruction word count. Do not read sizes from this table directly without decompiling that function.
- **`DAT_05daf138`** - 256-entry pointer dispatch table (8 bytes per entry). Indexed by runtime opcode byte. ~76 of 256 slots non-null (out-of-line handlers); the rest are handled inline in `luaV_execute`.

> ⚠️ **The "canonical" column in the scripts below is NOT the Luau enum ordinal.** It is the

### Jython - dump full handler table with runtime/canonical columns

```python
size_base      = toAddr(0x04ebde10)
unshuffle_base = toAddr(0x04ebdd10)
dispatch_base  = toAddr(0x05daf138)

for i in range(256):
    try:
        ptr = getLong(dispatch_base.add(i * 8))
        if ptr != 0:
            canonical = getByte(unshuffle_base.add(i)) & 0xff
            sz = getByte(size_base.add(canonical)) & 0xff
            print("runtime=0x%02x canonical=0x%02x size_byte=0x%02x handler=0x%08x" % (i, canonical, sz, ptr))
    except: pass
```

### Jython - label all handlers in Ghidra

```python
dispatch_base  = toAddr(0x05daf138)
unshuffle_base = toAddr(0x04ebdd10)

for i in range(256):
    try:
        ptr = getLong(dispatch_base.add(i * 8))

**luaV_execute internals:**
```
0x03f7747c = luaV_execute_dispatch  (trampoline - checks L+0x06 for NCG path)
0x03f77490 = luaV_ncg_loop          (outer NCG dispatch loop - see VM Core section)
0x03f772e0 = luaV_ncg_call          (NCG call trampoline - see VM Core section)
0x03f7b00c = luaV_execute           (main bytecode interpreter loop)
```

The interpreter caches `Proto->k` (constants array) into a register early in the
function body (`03f7b078`: `ldr x8,[x8,#0x38]`). Common opcodes like LOADK are handled
**inline** in the main loop and do not appear in the dispatch table.

**ARM64 register convention inside luaV_execute:**
```
x19 = L           (lua_State*)
x25 = dispatch table base (DAT_05daf138)
x26 = Closure*    (current function's closure object)
x27 = savedpc     (Instruction* - current bytecode position)
x28 = frame base  (L->base, &reg[0])
```

0x03f6d7e4 = luaM_newobject          (lua_State*, size_t, memcat) -> void*
0x03f6d65c = luaM_newvector          sized memory allocator helper
0x03f6d648 = luaG_toobig             no return - string > 0x40000000 bytes
```

### Bytecode / Protos
```
0x03f7ef1c = luaU_undump             bytecode loader (the full deserialization loop)
0x03f67e24 = luaF_newproto           Proto allocator
0x03035e5c = luaO_instcount          (byte canonical_opcode) -> int word_count
                                      applies transformation to DAT_04ebde10[canonical]
                                      to produce actual instruction word count (1 or 2)
                                      ⚠ decompile needed to decode DAT_04ebde10 values
```

### Strings
```
0x03f6fc34 = luaS_hash               (const char*, size_t) -> uint
0x03f6ff1c = luaS_newlstr            (lua_State*, const char*, size_t) -> TString*

### Tables
```

                                      Returns &DAT_04ebdbc0 (nil sentinel) on miss.
```

### Metamethods / Type System
```
0x03f75e60 = luaT_init
0x03f75f6c = luaT_gettmbyobj         (lua_State*, TValue*, uint event) -> TValue*
```

### Error Reporting
```
0x03f660f0 = luaG_runerror           no return

                                      Lua closures before invoking native executor
```

### GC (partial - needs luaC_step analysis)
```
0x03f6938c = luaC_barrier            GC write barrier (called on heap-obj store
                                      into black table)                     [MED]
0x03f693c0 = luaC_threadbarrier      GC barrier for thread objects; called in
                                      resume_start after L->isactive = true  [HIGH]
```

### Misc
```
0x03f7607c = luaO_tostring
0x03f76a08 = luaopen_vector          NOTE: not luaT_gettmbyobj - false lead
0x03f77254 = vector __index handler
```

### C API
```
0x03f5e5fc = luaL_register
0x03f5bae4 = lua_pushvector          (float x, float y, float z, lua_State*)
                                      NOTE: L is last arg - ARM64 float registers
                                      consume x/y/z first.
0x03f5c724 = lua_setfield
0x03f5c300 = lua_createtable / luaL_newlib
0x03f5bcc4 = lua_pushcfunction / lua_pushcclosure

                                       Values are encoded - use luaO_instcount
                                       (FUN_03035e5c) to get actual word count.

## What's Left

| Target | What it unlocks | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| GC functions (`luaC_step` etc.) | Distinguishes g+0x68 vs g+0x70 (grayagain/weak/allweak); closes g+0x78→g+0x30f GC list block | High |
| `FUN_03035e5c` (`luaO_instcount`) full decompile | Decodes DAT_04ebde10 size bytes → actual instruction word counts; identifies all AUX-word opcodes (LOADKX, CAPTURE, FASTCALL variants, JUMPXEQK*) | High |
| `g+0x30`, `g+0x318` | Zeroed unknowns; need `lua_resume` full body or upvalue fns | Med |
| `g+0x510` | = 1 on init; purpose unknown - could be a version flag or memcat ref count | Med |
| `g+0x500`→`g+0x768` gap | Extended Roblox-specific region; callback struct boundaries unclear | Med |
| `g+0x3400`, `g+0x3c00`, `g+0x4000` | Large _bzero'd blocks; likely Roblox sandbox data | Low |
| `Closure+0x04` | Likely nupvalues - byte between stacksize and isC | Low |
| `Table+0x06`, `+0x07` | Zeroed on init; likely padding | Low |
| `g+0x488`→`g+0x497` | 12 bytes between `mt[]` end and registry | Low |
| `g+0x4a8` | 0x70000000 confirmed present; purpose (memory cap?) still unknown | Low |
| `Proto+0x30` | Ptr written after deobfuscation; may be execdata/native code base | Low |
